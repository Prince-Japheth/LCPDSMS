                <h2>Security Features</h2>
                <p>The School Management System prioritizes the security of user data and the integrity of the system. A
                    range of security measures are implemented to protect sensitive information and ensure a safe user
                    experience. This section outlines the key security features in place.</p>

                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. User Authentication</h5>
                <p>Robust user authentication mechanisms are essential for ensuring that only authorized individuals can
                    access the system. The following methods are employed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Email Verification:</strong> Upon registration, users must verify their email addresses.
                        A verification link is sent to the provided email, and users must click this link to activate
                        their accounts. This step helps prevent unauthorized account creation and ensures that users
                        have access to their registered email.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strong Password Policies:</strong> Users are required to create strong passwords that
                        meet specific criteria, including a minimum length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase
                        letters, numbers, and special characters. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to
                        weak passwords.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Two-Step Authentication (2FA):</strong> For added security, the system offers two-step
                        authentication. Users can enable this feature to require a second form of verification (such as
                        a code sent to their mobile device) in addition to their password when logging in. This
                        significantly enhances account security.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Data Encryption</h5>
                <p>To protect sensitive information, the School Management System employs data encryption techniques:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> All sensitive data stored in the database, such as user
                        credentials and personal information, is encrypted. This ensures that even if unauthorized
                        access occurs, the data remains unreadable without the proper decryption keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> Data transmitted between users and the server is
                        encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. This protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle
                        attacks, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure during transmission.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. Access Control</h5>
                <p>The system implements strict access control measures to ensure that users can only access information
                    relevant to their roles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Users are assigned specific roles (e.g.,
                        student, teacher, administrator) that determine their access levels within the system. This
                        ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Session Management:</strong> User sessions are monitored and managed to prevent
                        unauthorized access. Sessions automatically expire after a period of inactivity, requiring users
                        to log in again to access the system.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">4. Regular Security Audits</h5>
                <p>The School Management System undergoes regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to
                    identify and address potential security risks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> The system is subjected to penetration testing by security
                        professionals to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Any identified
                        issues are promptly addressed to enhance system security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Software Updates:</strong> The system is regularly updated to incorporate the latest
                        security patches and improvements. This helps protect against known vulnerabilities and ensures
                        that the system remains secure against emerging threats.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">5. User Education and Awareness</h5>
                <p>Educating users about security best practices is crucial for maintaining a secure environment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Security Training:</strong> Users receive training on how to recognize phishing
                        attempts, create strong passwords, and protect their accounts. This empowers users to take an
                        active role in safeguarding their information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Regular Security Updates:</strong> Users are informed about any security updates or
                        changes to policies that may affect their accounts. This transparency helps build trust and
                        encourages users to follow security protocols.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">6. Incident Response Plan</h5>
                <p>In the event of a security breach or incident, the School Management System has a well-defined
                    incident response plan:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Immediate Action:</strong> The response team is trained to act quickly to contain and
                        mitigate any security incidents. This includes identifying the source of the breach and taking
                        steps to prevent further unauthorized access.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Notification:</strong> Affected users are promptly notified of any security
                        incidents that may impact their accounts. This includes providing guidance on steps they should
                        take to secure their accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Post-Incident Review:</strong> After an incident, a thorough review is conducted to
                        analyze the cause and effectiveness of the response. Lessons learned are used to improve
                        security measures and prevent future incidents.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        performance or fluctuations in enrollment numbers. This can help in recognizing successful
                        initiatives or areas needing attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compare Data:</strong> Use comparative analysis to evaluate different groups, such as
                        comparing the performance of students in different programs or courses. This can highlight
                        strengths and weaknesses across the institution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Key Metrics:</strong> Pay attention to key performance indicators (KPIs)
                        relevant to your role. For example, an administrator may focus on financial metrics, while a
                        teacher may prioritize student performance metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Utilize Visualizations:</strong> Take advantage of charts and graphs included in the
                        reports. Visual representations can make complex data easier to understand and communicate to
                        others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Act on Insights:</strong> Use the insights gained from the reports to inform decisions
                        and strategies. Whether it’s adjusting teaching methods, reallocating resources, or implementing
                        new programs, data-driven decisions can lead to improved outcomes for students and the
                        institution as a whole.</li>
